""" Assignment 6 - Blending

This file has a number of functions that you need to fill out in order to
complete the assignment. Please write the appropriate code, following the
instructions on which functions you may or may not use.

GENERAL RULES:
    1. DO NOT INCLUDE code that saves, shows, displays, writes the image that
    you are being passed in. Do that on your own if you need to save the images
    but the functions should NOT save the image to file. (This is a problem
    for us when grading because running 200 files results a lot of images being
    saved to file and opened in dialogs, which is not ideal). Thanks.

    2. DO NOT import any other libraries aside from the three libraries that we
    provide. You may not import anything else, you should be able to complete
    the assignment with the given libraries (and in most cases without them).

    3. DO NOT change the format of this file. Do not put functions into classes,
    or your own infrastructure. This makes grading very difficult for us. Please
    only write code in the allotted region.

  """ Convolve the input image with a generating kernel of parameter of 0.4 and
  then reduce its width and height by two.

  Please consult the lectures and readme for a more in-depth discussion of how
  to tackle the reduce function.

  You can use any / all functions to convolve and reduce the image, although
  the lectures have recommended methods that we advise since there are a lot
  of pieces to this assignment that need to work 'just right'.

  Args:
    image (numpy.ndarray): a grayscale image of shape (r, c)

  kernel with a parameter of 0.4.

  You should upsample the image, and then convolve it with a generating kernel
  of a = 0.4.

  Finally, multiply your output image by a factor of 4 in order to scale it
  back up. If you do not do this (and I recommend you try it out without that)
  you will see that your images darken as you apply the convolution. Please
  explain why this happens in your submission PDF.

    levels (uint8): A positive integer that specifies the number of reductions
                    you should do. So, if levels = 0, you should return a list

                    do one reduction. len(output) = levels + 1

  Returns:

                   itself). output[1] is layer 1 of the pyramid (image reduced

  Note: You must use your expand function in this function to generate the

  gaussPyramid function.

  Args:
    gaussPyr (list): A Gaussian Pyramid as returned by your gaussPyramid
                     function. It is a list of numpy.ndarray items.

  Returns:
    output (list): A laplacian pyramid of the same size as gaussPyr. This
                   pyramid should be represented in the same way as guassPyr, 
                   as a list of arrays. Every element of the list now

           layer of the input pyramid since it cannot be subtracted anymore.

  Note: Sometimes the size of the expanded image will be larger than the given
  layer. You should crop the expanded image to match in shape with the given
  layer.

  in an image of size 6x8. In this case, crop the expanded layer to 5x7.

def blend(laplPyrWhite, laplPyrBlack, gaussPyrMask):

  Args:
    laplPyrWhite (list): A laplacian pyramid of one image, as constructed by
                         your laplPyramid function.

    laplPyrBlack (list): A laplacian pyramid of another image, as constructed by
                         your laplPyramid function.

    gaussPyrMask (list): A gaussian pyramid of the mask. Each value is in the
                         range of [0, 1].

  The pyramids will have the same number of levels. Furthermore, each layer
  is guaranteed to have the same shape as previous levels.

  You should return a laplacian pyramid that is of the same dimensions as the 
  input pyramids. Every layer should be an alpha blend of the corresponding
  layers of the input pyramids, weighted by the gaussian mask. This means the
  following computation for each layer of the pyramid:
    output[i, j] = current_mask[i, j] * white_image[i, j] + 
                   (1 - current_mask[i, j]) * black_image[i, j]
  Therefore:
    Pixels where current_mask == 1 should be taken completely from the white
    image.
    Pixels where current_mask == 0 should be taken completely from the black
    image.

  Note: current_mask, white_image, and black_image are variables that refer to
  the image in the current layer we are looking at. You do this computation for
  every layer of the pyramid.

  Approach this problem as follows, start at the smallest layer of the pyramid.
  Expand the smallest layer, and add it to the second to smallest layer. Then,
  expand the second to smallest layer, and continue the process until you are
  at the largest image. This is your result.

  Note: sometimes expand will return an image that is larger than the next
  layer. In this case, you should crop the expanded image down to the size of
  the next layer. Look into numpy slicing / read our README to do this easily.

  For example, expanding a layer of size 3x4 will result in an image of size
  6x8. If the next layer is of size 5x7, crop the expanded image to size 5x7.
